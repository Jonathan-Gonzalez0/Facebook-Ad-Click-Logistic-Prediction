# Facebook-Ad-Click-Logistic-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict customer interactions with Facebook ads using logistic regression. Analyzes relationships between time spent on site, salary, and ad clicks. Includes data visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation with metrics, and decision boundary visualizations to gain insights into ad targeting.

Requirements: Python 3.12

Note: This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

Important: Place the CSV file (Facebook_Ads_2.csv) in the same folder as the Python file (FacebookAdsLogisticRegression.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration.
